## üìù Overview

A robust Flutter plugin designed for universal file downloading, offering reliable background operations with **Android foreground service support**. This plugin empowers your applications to handle various file types (images, videos, documents, archives) seamlessly, providing users with **real-time progress updates** and the ability to **cancel** ongoing transfers. It abstracts away the complexities of native download managers and Android permission handling across different API levels, making file management in your app straightforward and efficient.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Universal File Support:** Capable of downloading any file type from a given URL.
- **Reliable Background Downloads (Android):** Utilizes Android's Foreground Service to ensure downloads persist and continue uninterrupted even if the user navigates away from your app or the app is closed. This provides a resilient download experience.
- **Real-time Progress Stream:** Offers a continuous stream of `DownloadProgress` objects, allowing your Flutter UI to dynamically update with the current download percentage, downloaded bytes, total file size, and status (progress, completed, failed, cancelled).
- **Initiation & Cancellation:** Provides clear methods to start a new download and to request the cancellation of an active download.
- **Comprehensive Status Reporting:** Detailed `DownloadStatus` enum (e.g., `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `networkError`, `ioError`, `invalidParams`) provides precise feedback on the download's lifecycle.
- **Platform Exception Handling:** Catches and exposes native platform errors (e.g., missing permissions, service errors) for robust error management in your Dart code.
